For maggi you need a packet of maggi. First get a pot and pour in 210mL of water. Next let it heat, once steam starts coming out break up the maggi in 4 peices and put it in and also add the seasoning spice mix in the little pouch. Stir is whenever you get a chance and let it cook for 2 minutes. After 2 minutes stir it again and then turn off the gas and put something over it and let it sit there for about 1 minute. After that take it out in a plate or a bowl and eat and enjoy!
